# Lambdas & Stream Exercises 

## Description
Lambda expressions and the Streams API are two of the most powerful additions 
introduced in Java 8. These features enable the writing of more concise, expressive, 
and declarative code, making data manipulation clearer and more efficient.

In this task, you will learn to transform, filter, and sort collections using lambda 
expressions, as well as how to utilize functional interfaces to define reusable 
behaviors. You will also discover how to combine these tools to write functional and 
readable code, bringing you closer to widely adopted paradigms in modern development.
  
## Exercise Statement
Level 1: At this level you will become familiar with lambda expressions and the basic 
use of the Streams API for working with collections. You will learn to filter, 
transform, and sort data in a much more concise way than with traditional loops. You 
will also begin to understand how Functional Interfaces allow behaviors to be 
encapsulated. This is the first step toward thinking in more declarative code.
For all exercises, the Java 8+ Lambdas and Streams API must be used.

Level 2: Now that you have the fundamentals, you will focus on transforming 
collections in a more complex and expressive way. You will work with more specific 
conditions, combined operations, and direct modifications of elements. Additionally, 
you will create functional interfaces to represent arithmetic operations as reusable 
functions, approaching the functional paradigm.

Level 3: This level introduces the use of lambdas and streams applied to a custom 
class, Alumne, to simulate real-life situations. You will filter and transform lists 
of objects, applying multiple conditions and actions. This will help you understand 
the practical value of these tools in more realistic projects with structured data.

## Features
- Gain fluency in using lambdas and streams through practical exercises, from less 
to more complex, and to put into practice the new functional thinking habits that 
these tools provide.
